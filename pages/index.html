              <h3 class="border-bottom">Introduction</h3>
              <p>Welcome to Element design system. EDS is a pattern library for usage by developers and designers to speed up their working process. Whether you are using this design system for prototyping, experimentation or for use in a live project you can ease some of the time needed to get up and running with our FlexGrid system or pull components directly for use in your web pages.</p>
              <p>This design system was created by the owner Adam Elsbury to consolidate personal assets and organise things like text and heading sizes and weights for use in other projects instead of having to start from scratch. Hopefully it can help you too!</p>
              <h3 class="border-bottom margin-top">Why use Element?</h3>
              <h4 class="margin-top">Element is atomic</h4>
              <p>Following Brad Frost's Atomic design principles, Element was created with the developer or designer in mind. All components work in the same interface and group together without issue. No matter how big or small your project is. Modularity is our priority.</p>
              <h4 class="margin-top">Ability doesn't matter</h4>
              <p>Whether you are putting together your first "Hello world!" template or submitting a finished website to a client - Element caters for all. Our literature is easy to understand for beginners and we have jargon buster sections for our less experienced users!</p>
              <h4 class="margin-top">User centric design</h4>
              <p>Every single component has been rigorously user tested with live participants to ensure everything included is of the highest quality. It also gives you the peace of mind of not having to test it yourself. Each component is tested alone and in groups of elements to ensure design continuity.</p>
              <h4 class="margin-top">Rapidly evolving</h4>
              <p>Element was started as a University project but will continue to grow to help designers and developers alike. If you have any feedback about anything that could be done better, or if you would like to see something added that is missing - get in touch!</p>
              <h4 class="margin-top">Lightweight library</h4>
              <p>With less than 500 lines of CSS Element is a small, lightweight library that will not impact your page load times.</p>
